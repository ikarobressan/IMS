# Sistema para Gest√£o de Incidentes
# Incident Management System (IMS)

In urban daily life, we often come across different problems that directly affect the quality of life of the population, such as holes in asphalt, fallen trees and precarious lighting. This project aims to develop a mobile urban incident management application to allow the easy and agile communication of these incidents. Using iterative management, it is intended to analyze the needs of the application and show its viability, offering assistance in maintaining various situations and making life easier for people who do not have technical or professional knowledge to solve existing problems.
